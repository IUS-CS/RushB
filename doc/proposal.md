# About
Our team is planning on developing a lightweight, browser-based, arcade style side scrolling game. The rough idea at the moment is to have a "hero" that progresses through levels earning xp by defeating common enemies until you reach enough xp to spawn a level boss to defeat to move on to the next level.

# Dependencies
To implement this project, we'll take advantage of the Phaser JavaScript library. Phaser is a JavaScript library for making HTML5 games for desktops and mobile browsers. This library provides many useful methods that will allow us to create complex scenes and structures without having to implement it in raw html or write everything from scratch in JavaScript.

# Features
-Four progressive levels each in a different setting 
-Each level features a main boss with common enemies in which the main protagonist must fight
