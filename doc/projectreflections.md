As we wrap up this project we now know that building a game is harder than we expected. It is easy to find a library that has functions that you can use but finding something to test it with is a different task. Also it is hard to create a level or new tiles to make a game unique. Phaser had some great templates that you can use like a camera or sprites so in the future if we build another game we know that phaser is a good choice.
