# Project L

# Overview

Project L is a two-dimensional, web-based, side scrolling video game. The game features Onion Man, our open-sourced superhero, as the protagonist. Project L takes place on the planet L in which the protagonist will explore the land and collect stars. The game will be playable with any modern web browser on a computer.

# Implementation

The game will be written in HTML and JavaScript and will make use of the Phaser 3 framework. Our level was created by generating tilemaps and tilesets through Tiled, a free open-sourced software that allows one to create and edit levels.

# Features

Users will be able to jump onto platforms. The player will be able to collect items and store them in an inventory. There is a camera that will follow along as the character moves. The character will be controlled by the user with arrows on a keyboard and jump onto platforms by pressing the space bar.

# Usage

The idea is that the video game would be playable through any modern web browser.
