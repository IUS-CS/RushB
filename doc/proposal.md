# About
Our team is developing a lightweight, browser-based, arcade style side scrolling game. The idea is to have a controllable character to progress through a level capturing objects.

# Dependencies
To implement this project, we will take advantage of the Phaser JavaScript library. Phaser is a JavaScript library for making HTML5 games for desktops and mobile browsers. This library provides many useful methods that will allow us to create complex scenes and structures without having to implement it in raw html or write everything from scratch in JavaScript.

# Features
Our features will include one expansive, detailed level. The level will feature common objects such as stars.
